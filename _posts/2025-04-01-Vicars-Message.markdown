Acts1:3
 
‘After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proof that He was
alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.’
 

Dearly Beloved in Christ,
 
Greetings to you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
 

As we are in the season of the Great Lent, let us struggle together and refresh our spiritual life. Jesus
Christ turned the water into wine. A life in Christ is new and sweet. A life without Christ is bitter
and empty. The end of Great Lent brings us to Holy Week. Holy Week is filled with deeply solemn
and beautiful evening services that express the Passion of Christ up to his Crucifixion, Death and
Burial. I encourage you to drink deeply of this living water and be a part of as many services as you
can. May God bless each of you and your families on this Lenten journey to the joy of His
Resurrection!
 

Jesus is worthy of our complete devotion, our love and our commitment to Him. We love Jesus
because He first loved us and demonstrated that love by dying on the cross, being buried in the tomb
and then the third day He rose from the grave. Let us reveal our love to Him by being obedient to
Him. May the power that of the cross and resurrected Christ be an inspiration for us as we move
forward in our spiritual journey. Let us use the power of the cross and the resurrected Christ as a
driving force for our lives, as we journey together! May the joy of the resurrection of our Lord be an
inspiration for us to move forward in our journey with Him, and to be true ambassadors of faith (2
Cor 5:20), living lives holy, pleasing, and acceptable to our Triune God. Let us experience Christ
together, as a faith community. Let us patiently wait for His return!
 
 

Saturday April 5th we will have our Choir Retreat. Congratulations for our New Junior Choir too!
Music is a living expression of faith, it can amuse, charm, annoy and challenge, it can provide
comfort and can be incredibly uplifting; For I am convinced that God has given us all gifts, and we
should use them to his glory. Thanks to all our Choir Members!
 

Please mark your calendar for our Parish Family Night on Saturday April 12th. May I invite your
wholehearted participation.


I would like to convey my sincere thanks to you all for making our Executive Committee Retreat
and Yuvajana Sakhyam Food fest festival a grand success. I am happy about some of your
generosity, spirit, hard work, and willingness to help our church. May God accept all your offerings
and bless you in abundance for the years to come!
 

Dearly Beloved, it’s time to move to a new place. From May 1,2025 onwards, we are assigned to a
parish in Kerala, Palakkad.
 
 
You are such an amazing Church, and it has been such a blessing to be your Vicar. I am continually
blown away by your compassion, generosity and willingness to serve. I can only hope that I have
inspired all of you as much as you have inspired me. Thank you so much for all that you do.
 

We are thankful to God Almighty for the blessed worship life and blessed memories we had at
Ebenezer, New York. What a privilege it has been to share the journey of faith with you. Our lives
have been interwoven in the fabric of faithful service to our Lord and Savior. We count it among our
deepest joys. We thank you for the Love, Prayers, Support and Dedication you have shown towards
us during our three-years ministry at Ebenezer Mar Thoma Church, New York. I would like to
express my sincere gratitude to office bearers, executive committee members and   other spiritual
organizations of 2022 through 2025. We wanted to say a big thank you for your time and effort in
helping in our Church ministering during the past years.
 
 
All through the Bible, God’s people are called to be ready to go where God is leading them; and
with those many examples as our guide, we will say yes to what God has envisioned as the next
chapter in our lives. Please continue to Pray for our ministry.  We will miss you all deeply. We will
miss your love and support. Please give your new minister, Rev. Joel Samuel Thomas the same
support and encouragement you have given to us. We will continue to hold you in our prayers and
ever be the friends to you that we have been.
 

I give thanks to God for the unique flavor of our shared ministry together.
 

Love and blessings, now and always
 

Rev George Abraham - Vicar
