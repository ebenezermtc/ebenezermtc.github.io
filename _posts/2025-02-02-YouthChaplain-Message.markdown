Beloved in Christ, 
“How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, ‘Your God reigns.’” - Isaiah 52:7

During Holy Week, we walk with Jesus through suffering and sacrifice. We remember the feet that walked toward betrayal, carried a cross up Golgotha’s hill, and were pierced with nails for our sins.

Isaiah calls these feet beautiful, not because they were untouched by pain, but because they carried good news: peace, salvation, and the powerful truth that “Your God reigns.” Good Friday reminds us that love can look like a cross. But the story does not end there. On the beautiful Feast of the Resurrection, we remember those same scarred feet walked out of the tomb in victory!

The silence of death was broken by an angel’s announcement:

“He is not here; He has risen, just as He said.” (Matthew 28:6)

The good news of Isaiah 52:7 was fulfilled in full. Jesus didn’t just proclaim peace, He became our peace. He didn’t just declare salvation, He conquered death to give it.

As we remember from the cross to the empty tomb this Holy Week, may we carry this message in our own lives, with steps that bring light into dark places, comfort into sorrow, and hope into despair.

Let our life, our walk, our witness declare:
Our God reigns! Christ Risen! Indeed He is Risen!

Prayerfully,
