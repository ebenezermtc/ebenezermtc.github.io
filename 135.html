<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;color:rgb(51, 153, 255);">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">The
conception about church and its functions should be a matter of discussion
these days. Many of us perceive church as something that functions within the
walls. We make huge buildings and all its glamour and want to present church as
a static monument. But Luke. 24: 13-31 illustrates the importance of perceiving
the church as a movement and understands its functions beyond the four walls.
After the resurrection Jesus wanted to meet two of His disciples, who were
travelling from Jerusalem to Emmaus, on the street. Often we want to see the
church on the stage and want to evaluate it according to the performance on the
stage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the statement of
Bishop Bernard Mores in this context. He said “if the people are not coming to
the church; the church should go to the people”.&nbsp; So this presents the church as something
moving towards people and not people moving towards the church. Church should
be movement from the stage to the streets</span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">Church:
reaching out people in their spaces</span></b></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">This
passage encourages us to understand church as the body of Christ, which is
reaching out people in their contexts. It may be on the streets, may be on the
work places, may on their homes so on and so forth. We, the church, should
understand the different situations in which its members and non members are
going through and should reach out them in their spaces. We need to redefine
the ‘space’ of the church today. Many a time the danger is we claim ourselves
as the body of Christ but fail to understand the parts of our body. We live as
one body but don’t know the pain and suffering of the different parts. Here
Jesus is confronting the desperate disciples and transforming them. Jesus was
able to understand them in their spaces and moved into their space. This is the
mission that He wants us to carry out in this generation. Are we able to move
into the spaces of others to understand them and communicate the love of
Christ.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">Church:
Walking near with others</span></b></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">We
live in busy world and we walk with many people. This passage challenges us to
ask the question ‘how many of us are walking near with each other. When the
Gospel writer wrote “Jesus walked near (along) with them” he intended to
communicate something. Jesus walked near with them. This is a model to the
church and to every one of us. These days we are becoming too impersonal to
each other. We don’t have time to relate with each other, to love each other
and to share with each other. Church is becoming a place where we ‘show up’ but
not share. Jesus removed their confusions and restored them to confessions by
walking near with them. Jesus gave them the hope in their hopelessness by
walking near with them. Church is a movement and not a monument. When it
becomes a monument it loses its life and movements. </span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">Church:
That abides with people</span></b></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">Jesus
represents the church here and abides with his confused disciples. Jesus
understood that they needed His abiding to remove all their confusions. They
were with a sad face and were arguing with each other. Jesus presence and words
transformed them from confusions to confessions. Many of us live with
confusions of our faith, confusions about relationships, confusions about our
morality and confusions about the future. Only Jesus presence and His words can
transform us. Church, the Body of Christ, should be an abiding presence with
the people who are in confusions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond, serif;">Let
us rededicate ourselves to redefine the role of the church, the body of Christ.
We are the church and God wants us to be a movement from the stage to the
streets, to be someone who walks near to each other and to be an abiding
presence. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
