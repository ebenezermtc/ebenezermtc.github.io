Glory be to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - One True God! Amen.


Wow, it is already February! How quickly time is flying!



As the world emphasizes romantic love, it's a great opportunity for Christians to focus on agape—God's unconditional, selfless love that transcends emotions and embraces action.



In 1 Corinthians 13, St. Paul's description of love as being patient and kind is truly a countercultural call to practice love that seeks others' well-being. This love is not limited to moments of celebration or affection but extends to those who are hard to love, like strangers, enemies, and those with different opinions. Beloved, as we persevere to embody this love, we discover ourselves evolving and motivated to bring Christ into everything we do.



Amid a world filled with hostility and division, embodying this Christlike love can serve as a powerful testimony. Uncomplicated acts of kindness, listening with empathy, and speaking truth in love cannot only recast relationships but also bring hope and positivity in the face of hardship.



I then implore us all to see that this Valentine's season, let's be intentional about reflecting God's love. 



Here's a simple challenge for the days ahead:



Pray for Someone Difficult to Love – Lift someone who has hurt or disagreed with you.
Commit to One Act of Unconditional Love – Show kindness without expecting anything in return.
Encourage Someone – Share a word of affirmation or encouragement with someone who might feel unseen.



May February inspire us to let God's love shape how we see and serve others, especially as we wait on the verge of Great Lent. Through this, we find reassurance and comfort in the ultimate love shown to us through Jesus Christ, guiding us in our daily interactions and decisions. 

In Christ's Love,
